### Name: Rubal Goyal
### Course: CS572 - Object Oriented Design Patterns
### Assignment: HW6

Thanks for the feedback of the previous assignment. It took 2-3 days to fix the issue, but now everything is working fine for HW5. After reading the slides and book, I understood how I need to implement the Iterator and Visitor Pattren. I faced challanges to implement both the pattrens, but at end everything went pretty well.
